Ready to use bottle installation of Photoshop CC 21

I assume you have adobe license of course. if you don't, nobody will blame you.

Everything working so far except panels arranging (classic wine bug) and font menu (it works but in a weird way )

Tested on RX580 + Ryzen 3600, svm enabled, no noticeable lag found except following

Known bug list

* When selecting font from the menu, the selection highlight is on wrong line. The actual font selected is one under your cursor.
* Moving panels may cause unstoppable eye-tearing window flicker. DOnt allow panels to undock and make backup (not snapshot!!!) of your installation before moving them.
* Sometimes moving cursor in text window sends the cursor adrift. Use the mouse.
